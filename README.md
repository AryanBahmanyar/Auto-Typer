# Auto-Typer
This script reads the contents of a text file and uses PyAutoGUI to automatically type it in on the focused window. It takes a required argument, the file path, and 2 optional arguments, the delay time (to give some time to bring another window in focus), and the time between each key press, both in seconds. The purpose of this project was to automate testing for interactive command-line programs.
